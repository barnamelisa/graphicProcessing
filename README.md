# ðŸŽ¨ 3D Scene Visualization Game

![Contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg)

ðŸ“Œ This repository contains a **C++** project for visualizing and interacting with a 3D scene. The scene allows for real-time manipulation of objects through scaling, translation, rotation, and camera movement, all controlled by the keyboard or mouse. It also includes various visual effects such as texture mapping, lighting sources, and animation transitions using **OpenGL**.

## ðŸ“Œ About  

This project demonstrates the use of OpenGL for 3D scene visualization, allowing for interactive control of the scene. Users can manipulate the environment using keyboard and mouse inputs, and various advanced features such as texture mapping, dynamic lighting, and object animations are included. The project also provides different rendering modes (solid, wireframe, polygonal, and smooth) to switch between and enhance the visualization experience.

## ðŸš€ Features  

-   Interactive scene manipulation: Navigate and control the scene in real-time using the keyboard and mouse (translation, scaling, rotation, camera movement).
-   Real-time animations for transitions and object movements.
-   Scene visualization modes: View the scene in solid, wireframe, polygonal, and smooth rendering modes.
-   Texture mapping: quality texture mapping applied to 3D objects, enhancing realism.
-   Fog effects: Introduces fog for enhanced depth perception and atmosphere in the scene.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following installed:
-   C++ Compiler
-   OpenGL (for 3D rendering)
-   GLFW (for windowing and input handling)
-   GLEW (for managing OpenGL extensions)
